      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <hr />
      <p><strong>Effective Date: [Insert Date]</strong></p>

      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the FairFare
        platform, which provides comparison services for third-party
        ride-hailing providers, including but not limited to Ola, Uber, and
        Rapido. By accessing or using the FairFare app or website, you agree to
        be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must
        not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Scope of Services</h2>
      <p>
        FairFare is a comparison platform that allows users to view Estimated
        Time of Arrival (ETA), pricing, and other relevant information from
        third-party cab services. FairFare does not provide transportation
        services directly. All transportation services are provided by
        independent third-party providers, such as Ola, Uber, and Rapido.
      </p>

      <h2>2. User Registration</h2>
      <p>
        To use FairFare, you may be required to create an account. You agree to
        provide accurate, current, and complete information during the
        registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate.
        You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
        credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Use of Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        When you use FairFare to book a ride, the actual transportation service
        is provided by a third-party provider (e.g., Ola, Uber, Rapido). You
        agree to comply with the terms and policies of these third-party
        providers. FairFare is not responsible for the actions, omissions, or
        policies of third-party providers, including but not limited to vehicle
        availability, ride quality, driver behavior, or pricing disputes.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Fares and Payments</h2>
      <p>
        Fare estimates provided on the FairFare platform are based on
        information supplied by third-party providers. Actual fares may vary due
        to factors such as traffic, demand, and route changes. Payments for
        rides are processed by the third-party providers, and FairFare does not
        collect or manage payments directly. You acknowledge that any disputes
        related to fares, refunds, or cancellations must be addressed with the
        third-party provider.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        The cancellation policies of third-party providers (e.g., Ola, Uber,
        Rapido) will apply to any bookings made via FairFare. FairFare is not
        responsible for any fees or charges related to cancellations. It is your
        responsibility to review the cancellation and refund policies of the
        third-party provider before confirming a booking.
      </p>

      <h2>6. User Conduct</h2>
      <p>When using FairFare, you agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use the Service in a lawful manner and only for the purposes intended.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not use the platform for any illegal, fraudulent, or unauthorized
          purposes.
        </li>
        <li>Respect the rights and privacy of other users and drivers.</li>
        <li>
          Not attempt to interfere with the operation of the Service, including
          hacking, reverse engineering, or introducing viruses.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Failure to adhere to these user conduct rules may result in immediate
        suspension or termination of your FairFare account, at our discretion,
        without prior notice.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Ratings and Reviews</h2>
      <p>
        FairFare may allow users to rate and review their experience with
        third-party providers. All ratings and reviews must be honest and based
        on actual experiences. You agree not to submit any false, misleading, or
        defamatory content. FairFare reserves the right to remove or edit
        reviews that violate these Terms or applicable laws.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        FairFare is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or
        consequential damages resulting from your use of the platform or
        third-party services. This includes, but is not limited to, personal
        injury, property damage, lost profits, or delay in service. FairFare
        provides a platform to facilitate ride comparison and bookings, but the
        transportation service is solely provided by third-party providers, over
        which FairFare has no control.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Third-Party Providers' Terms</h2>
      <p>
        Each third-party provider, including Ola, Uber, and Rapido, operates
        under its own terms and policies. It is your responsibility to review
        and accept those terms before completing a booking. FairFare is not
        responsible for any breaches of these third-party terms.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        FairFare reserves the right to terminate or suspend your access to the
        platform at any time if you breach these Terms, engage in illegal
        activities, or misuse the Service. Upon termination, you will no longer
        be permitted to use the Service, and your account may be deactivated.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
        [Insert Jurisdiction]. Any disputes arising out of or relating to these
        Terms or the use of FairFare will be subject to the exclusive
        jurisdiction of the courts located in [Insert Jurisdiction].
      </p>

      <h2>12. Amendments</h2>
      <p>
        FairFare reserves the right to modify or update these Terms at any time.
        Any changes will be posted on this page, and your continued use of the
        Service after such changes will constitute your acceptance of the
        revised Terms.
